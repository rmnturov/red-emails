      <h3>What is GrowthBot</h3>
      <p>GrowthBot is a chatbot for marketing and sales professionals -- or anyone that's
        working on growing a business (like startup folks). It connects to a variety
        of marketing systems (think HubSpot, Google Analytics, etc.) and gives you
        quick, easy access to information and services.</p>
      <h3>Example Questions</h3>
      <p>How much do companies spend on marketing? What PPC keywords is Dropbox.com
        buying? What marketing software does Zendesk.com use? Those are just a few
        of the powerful things you can ask GrowthBot.</p>
